Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the task of configuring and managing computer systems. It falls under the category of Configuration Management and is widely used for automating various IT processes such as provisioning, application deployment, and task automation.

Configuration Management: It involves managing and controlling the configuration of software, infrastructure, and systems to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency. Configuration Management tools like Ansible help organizations automate and streamline these processes.

Playbook: Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They are expressed in YAML format and define a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts.
Modules: Ansible uses modules to perform specific tasks on remote hosts, such as managing packages, files, services, users, and more. Modules can be executed directly from the command line or used within playbooks.
Roles: Roles are a way of organizing playbooks and other files in a reusable structure. They allow you to encapsulate and share functionality across multiple playbooks.
Ad-Hoc Commands: Ansible allows you to run ad-hoc commands from the command line to perform quick tasks on remote hosts without writing a playbook.
Integration: Ansible can integrate with various cloud providers, networking devices, and other infrastructure components through its extensive collection of modules and plugins.
